# 🌟 PubNub + MongoDB Project

Welcome to the **PubNub + MongoDB Project**! 🚀 This fun and dynamic project connects the dots between real-time communication and a robust database. Ready to dive in? Follow the instructions below to get started! 😎

## 🛠️ Getting Started

To set up and run this project, follow these easy steps:

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies
You'll need to install dependencies for both the frontend and backend:
```bash
cd backend
npm install
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

### 3️⃣ Configure PubNub
Set up your PubNub account and grab your **keysets**:
- **Publish Key**
- **Subscribe Key**
- **Secret Key**
- **User ID** (Feel free to decide this input!)

### 4️⃣ Save Configuration
Store the PubNub keysets inside a `.env` file in the `backend/config` folder. Here's an example:
```dotenv
PUBLISH_KEY=your_publish_key
SUBSCRIBE_KEY=your_subscribe_key
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
USER_ID=your_user_id
```

### 5️⃣ Add Your MongoDB URI
Include your `MONGO_URI` in the same `.env` file:
```dotenv
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_uri
```

### 6️⃣ Add Other Environment Variables
Set up these environment variables for JWT authentication:
```dotenv
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
JWT_TTL=90d
JWT_COOKIE_TTL=90
```

## 🚀 Running the Project

### Start the Frontend and Backend
From their respective directories:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Connect Additional Backend Nodes
For connecting other backend nodes, use:
```bash
